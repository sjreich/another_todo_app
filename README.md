This is very much work-in-progress.  It's a learning project with react and rails - another to-do app project.  I'm letting myself go down all of the rabbit holes here, so... real progress isn't really the goal.

I did succeed in getting this thing to revert a 'check' in a to-do box if the server fails to process the update correctly.  Not totally thrilled with the implementation, but it works!
